# CRACK THE LOCK GAME

A safe is locked with a key. The key is a string of characters that are all different from each other. 
You have a set of hints detailing characters that may belong in the key to the lock. 
Using those hints, find the key to the lock. 

I saw this problem type on tiktok and I wanted to find a way to solve it using code. I used an inference engine and knowledge-based system to solve the problem before rendering.

I learned alot of GUI stuff while using tkinter to render the problem.
